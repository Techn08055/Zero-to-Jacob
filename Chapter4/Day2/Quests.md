1. The `.link()` function is is used to "take" data from `/storage/` to `/public` or `/private` making it also available for other people.

2. You can create an `interface` for a `reasource` with only certain wanted things. Now you can `link` the interface with `/public/` after storing the `resource`. 
  Which in turn  will only expose certain things to the `/public/` path.
